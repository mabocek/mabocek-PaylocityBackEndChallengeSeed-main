### Requirements

- able to view employees and their dependents
- an employee may only have **1 spouse or domestic partner** (not both)  
  - this does not need to be implemented explicitly, but can serve to limit your test cases
- an employee may have an unlimited number of children

  - 26 paychecks per year with deductions spread as evenly as possible on each paycheck  
  - employees have a base cost of **$1,000 per month** (for benefits)  
  - each dependent represents an additional **$600 cost per month** (for benefits)  
  - employees that make more than **$80,000 per year** will incur an additional **2 % of their yearly salary** in benefits costs  
  - dependents that are **over 50 years old** will incur an additional **$200 per month**

### What are we looking for?

- understanding of business requirements
- correct implementation of requirements
- test coverage for the cost calculations

### What should you not waste time on?

- authentication/authorization
- input sanitization
- logging
- adding multiple projects to represent layersâ€¦ putting everything in the API project is fine
